### Three trees in Git
* Repository - Staging Index - Working Directory

### Git Workflow
1. __$git init__ Create a working directory (.git)
2. __$git add .__ The change moves from the working dir to staging index
3. __$git commit -m "Initial Commit"__ The change moves from the staging index to your repository
* NOTE: You can see all history of the changes by checking out the commits
