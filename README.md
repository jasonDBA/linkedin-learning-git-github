### Three trees in Git
* Repository - Staging Index - Working Directory

### Git Workflow
1. $git init: Create a working directory (.git)
2. $git add .: The change moves from the working dir to staging index
3. $git commit -m "Initial Commit": The change moves from the staging index to your repository
* NOTE: You can see all history of the changes by checking out the commits
